AlphaNumeric Serial 

I need a alphanumeric serial number to give unique string id.  it uses numbers and alphabets to make sequencial unique id.  It can use any range of alphanumeric and get next id so that I can get shorter id than numbers only id like car plate.  I made another version of this with recursion but it wasn't useful  because there were stack error when I got large numbers.  This code makes bigger number without errors than recursion version.  This is part of my project and can be useful to others.  There are two versions of golang and python.  Python version was made for a real project but golang version was made for future use.  I hope this can be helpful to others because I got helped by other people. :)
